# DataSet_Regression_Models
A Colab project focusing on a large dataset containing thousands of transactions with specific products.  The dataset has been cleaned and normalized for evaluation.
The excel dataset is a collection of transactions from an unspecified retailer. It contains thousands of online eCommerce orders focusing on specific products and volume ordered. Each transaction contains a minimum of one product ID. The data is summerized by the following:
customer membership status, order date, date of delivery, product ID, quantity ordered, transaction total, and cost per unit. "Product volume and Total Product Revenue" has been added for evaluation.
Using the MSE (mean squared error) we can generate models which evaluate actual vs predicted values. 
The selected target variable is "Product Volume" as it is a continuous variable. This variable can be used to predict the volume of future sales for specific products.
